- 👋 Hi, I’m @ralphster.  Living the good life in Silicon Valley.
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity and whatever IT necessary to move startups forward, from birth to productivity, profitability and exit strategy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about CyberSecurity. While I've used Linux and done many flavors of SysAdmin for years, it's important to keep current, 'cuz the tools are always changing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blue Hat hacking.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Ralphster@gmail.com works.  Also try [Meetup: HackerMojo](https://meetup.com/hackermojo/) on Friday nights.
