- 👋 Hi, I’m @ralphster.  Living the good life in Silicon Valley.
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity and whatever IT is necessary to move startups forward, from birth to productivity, profitability and exit strategy.
- 🌱 Currently I'm in UCB CyberSecurity Bootcamp. While I've used Linux and done many flavors of SysAdmin for years, it's important to keep current, 'cuz the tools and threats are always changing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blue Hat hacking.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Ralphster@gmail.com works.  Also try [Meetup: HackerMojo](https://meetup.com/hackermojo/) on Friday nights.
